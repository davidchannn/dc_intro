Welcome!

Thank you for stopping by! If you are here, it's probably because you were interested in seeing my physics calculator website. You can find it by viewing the public repository titled: LemonPhysics-Archive 🍋

As a side note...

I’m currently working on a few personal projects that interest me, which includes...
  - 👾 Creating my own video game and releasing it on Steam
  - 📲 Building a personal website to display achievements and my interests/skills
